//! Read-only lifecycle capabilities view (v7).
//!
//! Mirrors the transition guards enforced by [`crate::lifecycle`] so
//! off-chain clients and on-chain integrators can check which lifecycle
//! transitions are currently permitted for a borrower's credit line without
//! simulating the full entrypoint (state lookup + auth + status checks).
//!
//! # What
//!
//! [`capabilities`] returns a [`crate::types::LifecycleCapabilities`] bitmap
//! covering every state-changing lifecycle entrypoint:
//! `suspend_credit_line`, `self_suspend_credit_line`, `close_credit_line`
//! (both the unconditional admin path and the zero-utilization borrower
//! path), `default_credit_line`, and `reinstate_credit_line`.
//!
//! # How
//!
//! Each field is derived purely from the credit line's current
//! [`crate::types::CreditStatus`], its `utilized_amount`, and the protocol
//! pause flag — a pure storage read with no token CPIs, no auth checks, and
//! no mutation. When no credit line exists for `borrower`, every field is
//! `false`.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Every lifecycle transition in [`crate::lifecycle`] starts with
//! `assert_not_paused` followed by a status check; duplicating that logic
//! here (read-only, no panics) lets callers pre-flight a transition — e.g. a
//! keeper deciding whether `default_credit_line` is currently callable —
//! without spending gas on a reverting simulation.
//!
//! See [`docs/PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](../../../docs/PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) and
//! [`docs/state-machine.md`](../../../docs/state-machine.md) for the
//! authoritative transition table each field mirrors.
