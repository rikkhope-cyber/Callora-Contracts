//! # Mirror tier semantics
//!
//! Mirror-tier variants share their discriminant *and* their semantic
//! meaning with the canonical `ContractError` enum at
//! `contracts/credit/src/types.rs`. Concretely:
//!
//! - `InvalidAmount = 5`        → canonical `ContractError::InvalidAmount = 5`
//! - `Overflow = 12`            → canonical `ContractError::Overflow = 12`
//! - `MissingLiquidityToken = 22` → canonical `ContractError::MissingLiquidityToken = 22`
//! - `CollateralRatioBelowMinimum = 35` → canonical `ContractError::CollateralRatioBelowMinimum = 35`
//! - `InsufficientCollateralBalance = 39` → canonical `ContractError::InsufficientCollateralBalance = 39`
//!
//! SDK clients decoding an error code emitted from the collateral contract
//! can map the integer directly to the canonical table at
//! [`docs/ERROR_CODES.md`](../../../docs/ERROR_CODES.md).
//!
//! # Collateral-specific tier semantics
//!
//! The collateral-specific tier (codes `100+`) is reserved for errors that
//! have no canonical counterpart in the credit contract's `ContractError`.
//! Each new variant must come with:
//!
//! 1. A focused test in [`tests/catalog.rs`].
//! 2. A row in [`docs/errors/collateral.md`](../../../docs/errors/collateral.md).
