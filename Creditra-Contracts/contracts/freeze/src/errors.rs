//!
//! Mirror-tier variants share their discriminant *and* their semantic
//! meaning with the canonical `ContractError` enum at
//! `contracts/credit/src/types.rs`. Concretely:
//!
//! - `CreditLineNotFound = 3` → canonical `ContractError::CreditLineNotFound = 3`
//! - `BorrowerBlocked = 16` → canonical `ContractError::BorrowerBlocked = 16`
//! - `DrawsFrozen = 19` → canonical `ContractError::DrawsFrozen = 19`
//! - `BorrowerFrozen = 40` → canonical `ContractError::BorrowerFrozen = 40`
//! - `CreditLineFrozen = 46` → canonical `ContractError::CreditLineFrozen = 46`
//!
//! SDK clients decoding an error code emitted from the freeze contract
//! can map the integer directly to the canonical table at
//! [`docs/ERROR_CODES.md`](../../../docs/ERROR_CODES.md).
//!
//! # Freeze-specific tier semantics
//!
//! The freeze-specific tier (codes `100+`) is reserved for errors that
//! have no canonical counterpart in the credit contract's `ContractError`.
//! Each new variant must come with:
//!
//! 1. A focused test in `mod tests`.
//! 2. A row in [`docs/errors/freeze.md`](../../../docs/errors/freeze.md).

/// # Tier system
///
/// Variants belong to one of two tiers:
///
/// - **Mirror tier** (`3`, `16`, `19`, `40`, `46`) — semantic twins of the
///   canonical `ContractError` codes; SDK clients can match them against
///   [`docs/ERROR_CODES.md`](../../../docs/ERROR_CODES.md).
/// - **Freeze-specific tier** (`100+`) — namespaced to leave a clear gap
///   from the credit contract's `1..49` range, defending against accidental
///   collisions if either contract appends to its enum in the future.
