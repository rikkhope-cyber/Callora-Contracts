//! Structured lifecycle events for the freeze (v7) contract.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! Defines typed event structs and publisher helpers for every freeze
//! lifecycle transition. Off-chain indexers subscribe to these events
//! to track the full freeze/unfreeze history without polling storage.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! | Event struct | Publisher fn | Topic | Trigger |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`DrawsFrozenEvent`] | [`publish_draws_frozen`] | `("freeze","drw_frz")` | `freeze_draws` / `unfreeze_draws` |
//! | [`CreditLineFrozenEvent`] | [`publish_credit_line_frozen`] | `("freeze","ln_frz")` | `freeze_credit_line` / `unfreeze_credit_line` |
//! | [`BorrowerFrozenEvent`] | [`publish_borrower_frozen`] | `("freeze","brw_frz")` | `freeze_borrower_until` |
//! | [`BorrowerUnfrozenEvent`] | [`publish_borrower_unfrozen`] | `("freeze","brw_ufz")` | `unfreeze_borrower` |
//!
//! # Topics
//!
//! All events are published under the `("freeze", _)` namespace using
//! `symbol_short!` (≤ 9 characters) for cheap on-chain encoding. Topics
//! are intentionally distinct from the `("credit", _)` namespace used by
//! the credit contract's internal events to allow independent subscriptions.
//!
//! # ABI Stability
//!
//! Event topics and payload field layouts form part of the public ABI.
//! Breaking changes require a new topic with a version suffix
//! (e.g., `("freeze","drw_frz2")`). Existing fields must never be removed
//! or reordered.
//!
//! # See also
//!
//! - `contracts/accrual/src/events.rs` — accrual event pattern.
//! - `contracts/credit/src/events.rs` — credit contract internal events.
//! - `docs/EVENTS_CATALOG.md` — canonical cross-contract event catalog.
