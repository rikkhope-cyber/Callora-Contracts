//! Cross-chain liquidation hook.
//!
//! Consumes bridge attestations and triggers local liquidation safely.
//!
//! # `no_std` / WASM compatibility
//!
//! This module is **not** compiled into the WASM artifact. It is gated with
//! `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` because it uses `std` collections
//! (`HashSet`) and `println!` which are unavailable in the Soroban host
//! environment.  All production cross-chain logic that runs on-chain must go
//! through the main contract entrypoints; this module exists for off-chain
//! tooling and integration harnesses only.
