//! Per-borrower exposure cap for the Credit contract.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! Provides an absolute `i128` cap on total borrowed exposure per borrower,
//! enforced during [`draw_credit`]. Unlike the utilization cap (which is a
//! percentage of `credit_limit`), this is a flat amount ceiling independent of
//! the credit limit.
//!
//! # How
//!
//! The cap is stored under [`DataKey::MaxBorrowerExposure(Address)`] in
//! persistent storage and administered via `set_borrower_exposure_cap`.
//! The check function [`check_borrower_exposure_cap`] is called during
//! `draw_credit` after the utilization cap check and before the global
//! exposure cap check.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! A per-borrower absolute exposure cap protects the protocol from
//! concentration risk — no single borrower can draw more than the cap
//! even if their credit limit is higher. This is complementary to the
//! global [`MaxTotalExposure`] cap.
