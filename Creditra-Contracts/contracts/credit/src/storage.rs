//! Storage abstraction for the Credit contract.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! Defines the [`DataKey`] enum (30 variants) and provides typed getters /
//! setters for every persistent and instance storage slot in the credit
//! contract. Also owns the reentrancy guard, pause flag, monotonic-timestamp
//! assertion, and the per-borrower id ↔ address mapping used by enumeration.
//!
//! # How
//!
//! Variants are partitioned across Soroban's two long-lived storage tiers:
//!
//! - **Instance storage** — small, hot, always loaded with the contract.
//!   Holds admin/proposal/pause state, the rate formula and rate-change
//!   configs, global accumulators (`TotalUtilized`, `TotalCollateral`,
//!   `CreditLineCount`, `TreasuryBalance`), per-protocol caps, the oracle config and last
//!   price, and the auction-contract pointer.
//! - **Persistent storage** — keyed, per-borrower state with TTL. Holds the
//!   `CreditLineData` itself (under `CreditLineIdByBorrower(Address)`), the
//!   blocklist flag, utilization cap, rate floor, repayment schedule,
//!   collateral balance, draw audit / reversal log, and the
//!   `(borrower, settlement_id)` replay marker for default settlement.
//!
//! Every persistent read goes through helpers that call
//! [`bump_credit_line_ttl`] (which extends the entry to
//! `LEDGER_BUMP_AMOUNT ≈ 6 months` when the remaining TTL drops below
//! `LEDGER_BUMP_THRESHOLD ≈ 3 months`). This means an active borrower's
//! state is automatically refreshed on every interaction.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Centralizing every storage access here lets the contract enforce three
//! invariants in one place:
//!
//! 1. **TTL hygiene** — no caller forgets to bump.
//! 2. **TotalUtilized conservation** — [`persist_credit_line`] is the only
//!    write path for `CreditLineData` and atomically adjusts the global
//!    `TotalUtilized` accumulator using the caller-captured
//!    `previous_utilized`. `Overflow = 12` reverts if the delta over- or
//!    under-flows.
//! 3. **Monotonic timestamps** — [`assert_ts_monotonic`] is the single
//!    chokepoint that callers use to enforce `last_accrual_ts`,
//!    `last_rate_update_ts`, and `suspension_ts` are non-decreasing.
//!
//! # Reentrancy & pause primitives
//!
//! The instance `Symbol("reentrancy")` slot is set by
//! [`set_reentrancy_guard`] (which reverts `Reentrancy = 11` if already
//! set) and cleared by [`clear_reentrancy_guard`]. The instance
//! `Symbol("paused")` slot is consulted via [`assert_not_paused`] which
//! reverts `Paused = 18` when the protocol is paused.
//!
//! See [`docs/storage-layout.md`](../../../docs/storage-layout.md) for the
//! tier reference and
//! [`docs/PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](../../../docs/PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) §3 for the
//! full per-variant tier table.

//
// Numbers below assume ~5 seconds/ledger close.

//   3 months = 7_776_000 s   = 1_555_200 ledgers
//   6 months = 15_552_000 s  = 3_110_400 ledgers
