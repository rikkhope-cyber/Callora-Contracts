//! Protocol fee skim split between treasury and bounty pools.
//!
//! When a borrower repays interest, the protocol fee (`ProtocolFeeBps`) is
//! skimmed into the contract and allocated between two accumulators by
//! [`TreasuryFeeShareBps`]:
//!
//! - **Treasury** — withdrawable via `withdraw_treasury` to `TreasuryAddress`.
//! - **Bounty pool** — withdrawable via `withdraw_bounty` to `BountyAddress`.
//!
//! The treasury share is computed with floor rounding; the bounty pool receives
//! the remainder so no tokens are lost to integer division.
