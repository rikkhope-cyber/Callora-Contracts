/// ```
///
/// # Interpretation
///
/// - Returns `u32::MAX` when `utilized_amount == 0` (no debt → infinitely
///   healthy).
/// - A value below `10_000` means the position is under-collateralized and
///   eligible for liquidation (`default_credit_line`).
/// - A value of `10_000` means the collateral exactly covers the minimum
///   required amount.
/// - A value above `10_000` means the position is over-collateralized relative
///   to the minimum ratio.
///
/// # Read-only guarantee
///
/// This function reads the borrower's credit line (which may bump Persistent
/// entry TTL if below the threshold), the collateral balance, and the global
/// `MinCollateralRatioBps` config.  It performs **no** storage writes.
///
/// # Default minimum collateral ratio
///
/// When `MinCollateralRatioBps` is not configured, the function falls back to
/// `15000` (150 %), matching the draw-time enforcement in `draw_credit`.
///
/// # Edge cases
///
/// - Borrower has no credit line or a `Closed` line: still computes the ratio
///   from the on-chain collateral balance and the stored `utilized_amount`.
///   Returning `u32::MAX` for zero utilization covers the "healthy" case even
///   for a closed line.
/// - `utilized_amount` is negative (should never happen): returns `u32::MAX`
///   via the zero-utilised short-circuit since the storage invariant enforces
///   `utilized_amount >= 0`.
/// # Authentication
/// No authentication required. This is a pure read — it computes the health
/// ratio from on-chain data without modifying any storage.
