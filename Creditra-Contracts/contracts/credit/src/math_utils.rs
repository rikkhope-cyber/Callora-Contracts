//! # Fixed-Point Interest Math Utilities
//!
//! Deterministic, integer-only arithmetic helpers used by the interest
//! accrual path in [`crate::accrual`] and by oracle deviation checks in
//! [`crate::lib::settle_default_liquidation`].
//!
//! ## What
//!
//! - [`mul_div`] — checked `a * num / denom` with explicit [`Rounding`].
//! - [`apply_bps`] — apply a `bps` rate to a `u128` principal.
//! - [`prorate_interest`] — the live accrual primitive:
//!   `floor((u * r * Δt) / (10_000 * 31_557_600))`.
//! - [`compute_deviation_bps`] — oracle deviation in bps between two
//!   prices; `None` when the prior price is non-positive; saturates to
//!   `u32::MAX` on absurd new prices to ensure the circuit breaker still
//!   trips.
//! - [`scale_up`] / [`scale_down`] — 10^18 fixed-point helpers.
//!
//! ## How
//!
//! All intermediate products are promoted to `u128` and multiplied with
//! checked primitives; overflow panics (which in `apply_accrual`'s caller
//! is translated into `ContractError::Overflow = 12`). The caller chooses
//! whether the division remainder is discarded (floor) or rounded up
//! (ceiling) via [`Rounding`].
//!
//! Interest rates are in **basis points** (`1 bps = 1 / 10_000`). Time is in
//! ledger seconds; one **Julian year** is defined as
//! [`SECONDS_PER_YEAR`] `= 31_557_600` (365.25 × 86 400), matching the
//! convention used by most on-chain interest protocols. The pre-computed
//! constant [`BPS_YEAR_DENOM`] `= BPS_DENOMINATOR * SECONDS_PER_YEAR` lets
//! the final division be a single `u128` operation.
//!
//! ## Why (overflow safety)
//!
//! The worst-case intermediate product is:
//!
//! ```text
//! principal  ≤ i128::MAX  ≈ 1.7 × 10^38
//! rate_bps   ≤ 10_000
//! time_delta ≤ u64::MAX   ≈ 1.8 × 10^19
//! SCALE      = 10^18
//! ```
//!
//! `principal * rate_bps * time_delta` can reach ~3 × 10^61, which overflows
//! `u128` (max ~3.4 × 10^38). The multiplication is therefore split into two
//! checked steps:
//!
//! 1. `a = principal * rate_bps` — fits in u128 for any realistic principal
//!    (≤ 10^28 × 10^4 = 10^32 < 10^38).
//! 2. `b = a * time_delta` — checked; panics on overflow.
//!
//! The combination of `checked_mul` here and `overflow-checks = true` in
//! the release profile (see workspace `Cargo.toml`) is what makes the
//! accounting layer formally overflow-safe.
//!
//! ## Rounding direction
//!
//! For accrual the caller passes [`Rounding::Floor`], so every realized
//! `ΔI` rounds **down**. This biases the rounding error against protocol
//! revenue and never against the borrower's balance — a deliberate safety
//! property documented in [`docs/RISK_PRICING.md`](../../../docs/RISK_PRICING.md).

/// Deterministically apportion `total` across `weights` so that the returned
/// parts **always sum exactly to `total`** — no dust is created or destroyed.

/// This is the canonical "largest-remainder" (Hamilton) method:
///
/// 1. Each bucket `i` receives `floor(total * w_i / W)` where `W` is the sum of
///    all weights.
/// 2. The leftover `total - Σ floor(...)` (strictly less than the number of
///    buckets, so at most one unit can be owed to any single bucket) is handed
///    out one unit at a time to the buckets with the largest *fractional*
///    remainder (`total * w_i mod W`).
/// 3. Ties on the fractional remainder are broken **deterministically** by
///    ascending index, so identical inputs always yield identical output.
///
/// # Why this matters for interest
///
/// Independent `floor` rounding of each recipient's share loses up to one base
/// unit *per recipient* to truncation and — worse — makes the allocation depend
/// on the *order* weights are supplied or the *number* of recipients. That is
/// exactly the class of bug this issue closes: dust that leaks out of the system
/// or is misallocated between treasury / bounty / lender. With this helper the
/// total is conserved to the last base unit and the split is reproducible.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `total` — amount (e.g. an interest or fee amount) to split, in the
///   contract's native token unit.
/// - `weights` — non-negative integer weights; need **not** sum to any fixed
///   value. A weight of `0` simply receives no share beyond a deterministic
///   leftover tie-break.
