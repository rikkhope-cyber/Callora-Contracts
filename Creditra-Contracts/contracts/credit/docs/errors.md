# Contract Error Reference

This document provides detailed information about all error variants in the Creditra credit contract.

## Error Discriminants

All errors are represented as `ContractError` enum variants with stable discriminant values. These discriminants are **permanent** and must never be reordered or renumbered.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Attempting to draw while `DataKey::CreditLineFreeze` is set for the borrower

---

### 31. ExposureCapExceeded (Code: 31)
**Description:** Draw would exceed the global protocol exposure cap.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- `total_utilized + draw_amount > max_total_exposure`
- Protocol-wide utilization limit reached

**Recovery:** Wait for other borrowers to repay, or admin can increase cap.

---

### 32. AdminNotInitialized (Code: 32)
**Description:** Admin address has not been initialized in contract storage.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Calling admin-only functions before `init()` is called
- Contract deployment incomplete

**Recovery:** Call `init()` with admin address first.

---

### 33. TimestampRegression (Code: 33)
**Description:** Timestamp regression detected (new timestamp is not greater than stored timestamp).

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Ledger timestamp moved backwards (should not occur in normal operation)
- Defensive check triggered

**Recovery:** This indicates a serious ledger issue. Contact support.

---

### 34. LimitOutOfBounds (Code: 34)
**Description:** Credit limit is outside the configured minimum/maximum bounds.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Opening credit line with `credit_limit < min_credit_limit`
- Opening credit line with `credit_limit > max_credit_limit`
- Updating risk parameters to set limit outside bounds
- Setting `max_credit_limit < min_credit_limit` in bounds configuration

**Recovery:** 
- For credit line operations: Use a limit within the configured bounds
- For bounds configuration: Ensure `min >= 0` and `max >= min`
- Query current bounds using `get_credit_limit_bounds()` to see valid range

**Related Functions:**
- `set_credit_limit_bounds(min, max)` - Configure global bounds (admin only)
- `get_credit_limit_bounds()` - Query current bounds
- `open_credit_line()` - Validates limit against bounds
- `update_risk_parameters()` - Validates new limit against bounds

**Example:**
```rust
// Admin sets bounds
client.set_credit_limit_bounds(&10_000, &1_000_000);

// Valid: within bounds
client.open_credit_line(&borrower, &500_000, &500, &50); // ✅

// Invalid: below minimum
client.open_credit_line(&borrower, &5_000, &500, &50); // ❌ Error 34

// Invalid: above maximum
client.open_credit_line(&borrower, &2_000_000, &500, &50); // ❌ Error 34
```

**Security Rationale:**
This error protects the protocol from extreme concentration risk by enforcing admin-configurable minimum and maximum credit limits. It prevents:
- Malicious or erroneous admin actions that could create excessively large credit lines
- Credit lines too small to be economically viable
- Concentration of protocol risk in a small number of large borrowers

---

### 45. AlreadySettled (Code: 45)
**Description:** The liquidation for this (borrower, settlement_id) pair has already been settled.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Calling `settle_default_liquidation` with a `settlement_id` that has already been used
- Replay attack protection triggered

**Recovery:** No action needed — the settlement has already been processed. Use a unique `settlement_id` per liquidation event.

---

### 50. CollateralInsufficient (Code: 50)
**Description:** Collateral is insufficient for the requested operation.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- An operation requires more collateral than is available or posted
- A general collateral shortfall where a more specific code
  (`CollateralRatioBelowMinimum` / `InsufficientCollateralBalance`) does not apply

**Recovery:** Deposit additional collateral or reduce the size of the requested
operation until collateral coverage is adequate.

---

## Error Handling Best Practices

### For SDK Clients

```rust
use creditra_credit::types::ContractError;

match client.try_draw_credit(&borrower, &amount) {
    Ok(_) => println!("Draw successful"),
    Err(Error::Contract(code)) => {
        match code {
            3 => println!("Credit line not found - open one first"),
            6 => println!("Draw exceeds limit - reduce amount"),
            24 => println!("Insufficient reserve - try again later"),
            34 => println!("Limit outside configured bounds"),
            _ => println!("Error code: {}", code),
        }
    }
    Err(e) => println!("Other error: {:?}", e),
}
```

### For Contract Developers

- Always use `env.panic_with_error(ContractError::SpecificError)` instead of `panic!()` or `unwrap()`
- Never reorder or renumber existing error discriminants
- Add new errors at the end of the enum with the next available number
- Update this documentation when adding new errors
- Write integration tests that verify the correct error discriminant is returned

---

## Stability Guarantee

Error discriminants are **permanent** and form part of the contract's public API. Once assigned, a discriminant value must never be changed or reused. This ensures:

- SDK clients can reliably match on error codes
- Error handling logic remains stable across contract upgrades
- Integrators can build robust error recovery mechanisms
