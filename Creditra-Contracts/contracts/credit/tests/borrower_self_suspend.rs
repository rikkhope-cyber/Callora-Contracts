//! Comprehensive Integration Test Suite for `self_suspend_credit_line`
//!
//! This test suite validates the borrower self-suspension feature, which allows
//! a borrower to voluntarily freeze their own line of credit without admin intervention.
//!
//! # Test Coverage Matrix
//!
//! ## 1. Authorization Matrix (Signer Validation)
//! - ✓ Borrower can successfully self-suspend their own active line
//! - ✓ Admin cannot invoke self-suspend (authorization failure)
//! - ✓ Third-party addresses cannot invoke self-suspend (authorization failure)
//!
//! ## 2. State Machine Matrix (Status Validation)
//! - ✓ Self-suspension succeeds from Active status
//! - ✓ Self-suspension fails from Suspended status
//! - ✓ Self-suspension fails from Defaulted status
//! - ✓ Self-suspension fails from Closed status
//! - ✓ Self-suspension fails when credit line does not exist
//!
//! ## 3. Functional Capabilities Post-Suspension
//! - ✓ Draw operations are blocked after self-suspension
//! - ✓ Repayment operations remain allowed after self-suspension
//! - ✓ Admin can reinstate a self-suspended line to Active
//! - ✓ Admin can force-close a self-suspended line
//! - ✓ Utilization amount is preserved during self-suspension
//!
//! ## 4. Event Emission & State Integrity
//! - ✓ Self-suspension emits correct event with proper parameters
//! - ✓ Credit parameters (limit, rate, score) remain unchanged
//! - ✓ Idempotency check: calling self-suspend on already suspended line fails
