# Creditra Execution Quality — The Receipts

This document is the answer to "is this codebase serious?". It catalogs the
concrete artifacts of execution quality — test count, coverage, CI surface,
PR cadence, deployment checklist — that a reviewer can verify in a few
minutes by running the commands at the bottom of each section.

Companion: `COVERAGE_REPORT.md` (per-issue coverage snapshots),
`TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` (workspace-level coverage report at v1.0 cutoff),
`TEST_VALIDATION.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`,
`UNWRAP_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `POST_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md`,
`AUDIT_SUMMARY.md`.

### 1.4 Auction tests — `gateway-contract/contracts/auction_contract/src/test.rs`

1 934 lines of tests covering:

- Init parameter validation (English & Dutch modes)
- English bid flow: increment enforcement, refund-on-outbid
- Dutch bid flow: linear-decay pricing, immediate close on qualifying bid
- `close_auction` idempotency
- Cross-contract `settle_default_liquidation` (factory-only auth,
  replay protection, return value)
- `claim_auction` (winner-only, post-settlement)
- Reentrancy guard around refund + claim

### 1.5 Total test surface

The workspace has **~817 `#[test]` annotations** across source and tests
(reproduce with `grep -r '#\[test\]' contracts/ gateway-contract/ | wc -l`).
The bulk live in the 42 integration files and the auction's `test.rs`.

---

## 2. Coverage

### 2.1 Current numbers

From `README.md` and `COVERAGE_REPORT.md` (most recent run):

- **Regions: 99.51 %**
- **Lines: 98.94 %**
- **Threshold enforced in CI: 95.00 %** (`cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 95`)

### 2.2 Reproducing locally

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-targets --fail-under-lines 95
```

The CI workflow at `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` runs this on every push
to `main`/`master` and on every PR.

### 2.3 What is not covered

Per `COVERAGE_REPORT.md`, the small remaining gap is in stub functions used
during earlier development (`repay_credit` placeholder, etc.) — these have
since been replaced by full implementations. The current gap (1.06 % lines)
is in defensively-dead branches that revert with `ContractError::Overflow`
under arithmetic conditions only reachable by misconfigured constants
(e.g. `MaxRepayAmount > i128::MAX / 2`). These paths are tested but the
revert is the only observable behavior.

---

## 3. Property & Fuzz Tests

The project uses targeted property-style tests rather than a full fuzzing
harness. Concrete property tests:

- `tests/duplicate_open_policy.rs` — generated open-sequence property
- `tests/total_utilized_invariant.rs` — random action sequences, asserts
  invariant
- `tests/state_transition_invariants.rs` — random transition sequences,
  asserts state-machine invariants
- `tests/accrual_overflow_audit.rs` — sweeps `(u, r, Δt)` over wide ranges
  for overflow safety
- `tests/borrower_key_encoding.rs` — property-style key isolation
- `contracts/creditra-credit/tests/snap_prorate.rs` — 4 096-entry pinned
  JSON snapshot + 8 proptest properties for `accrued_interest` (the CosmWasm
  accrual primitive); mirrors the Soroban `snapshot_prorate_interest.rs`
  suite. See `docs/contributing-tests.md` for the regeneration workflow.

A `cargo fuzz` harness for `apply_accrual` and `compute_rate_from_score` is
listed as a follow-up in `POST_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` — the targets are simple
pure functions and would slot in cleanly.

---

## 4. CI / Build Matrix

CI workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | push (`main`/`master`/`develop`/`feature/**`) and PR | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`, then WASM build with a hard **50 KB size budget** (`THRESHOLD_BYTES=51200`) |
| `test.yml` | push / PR | `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` |
| `coverage.yml` | push (`main`/`master`) and PR | `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-targets --fail-under-lines 95` |
| `pr-coverage.yml` | PR | Comment-with-coverage-delta on PRs |
| `build-wasm.yml` | push / PR | Release-WASM artifact build for `creditra-credit` and `gateway-auction`, uploads to artifact storage |
| `wasm-size.yml` | push / PR | Build all workspace WASM via `scripts/check-wasm-size.sh`; fail if **any** artifact exceeds **100 KiB** (`THRESHOLD_BYTES=102400`) |
| `gas.yml` | push / PR | Per-entrypoint CPU/memory budget regression against `contracts/.gas-baseline.json` (via `instrument` feature) |

The size-budget enforcement is the load-bearing one: it guarantees the WASM
artifact stays deployable under Soroban's per-contract bytecode limits. The
release profile in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
overflow-checks = true     # arithmetic overflow → panic, not wrap
debug = 0
strip = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic = "abort"
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

`overflow-checks = true` in *release* is unusual and intentional — it makes
the entire `i128` accounting layer revert on overflow instead of silently
wrapping, even when CI builds with `--release`.

---

## 5. Static Quality Gates

- **`cargo fmt --check`** — enforced in CI.
- **`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`** — enforced in CI (warnings fail the
  build).
- **Zero production `unwrap()` / `expect()`.** Tracked in
  `UNWRAP_AUDIT_REPORT.md` (PR #418 / #421 removed the last ones). Every
  production code path returns a `ContractError` instead of panicking.
- **`error_discriminants.rs`** — CI test fails on any reorder/renumber of
  `ContractError`, preventing breaking ABI changes.
- **`event_topic_stability.rs`** — CI test pins event topic strings.
- **WASM size budget** — CI fails if the release WASM exceeds 50 KB.
- **Gas / CPU budget regression** — `gas.yml` compares Soroban resource usage
  per entrypoint against pinned baselines. Implementation lives in
  `contracts/credit/src/instrument.rs` (host-only, `instrument` Cargo feature).
  Regenerate baselines with `./scripts/regen_budget_baseline.sh`; run checks
  with `./scripts/gas-regression.sh`.

- [ ] `soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/creditra_credit.wasm --source <identity> --network testnet`
- [ ] Record the contract address (use later in `set_auction_contract`)
- [ ] Deploy the auction contract similarly from
      `gateway-contract/contracts/auction_contract/`
- [ ] Call `init(admin)` once on credit contract; expect success
- [ ] Call `init(admin)` again; expect `AlreadyInitialized = 14` (deployment
      sanity)
- [ ] `set_liquidity_token(token_address)`
- [ ] `set_liquidity_source(reserve_address)` (or accept default = contract)
- [ ] `set_auction_contract(auction_address)`
- [ ] `set_max_draw_amount`, `set_max_repay_amount`,
      `set_draw_min_interval` — operational caps
- [ ] `set_max_total_exposure` — global cap

- [ ] `set_penalty_surcharge_bps(...)`, `set_grace_period_config(...)`
- [ ] `set_protocol_fee_bps(...)`, `set_treasury(admin, treasury)`
- [ ] Run a happy-path smoke: `open_credit_line` → `draw_credit` →
      `repay_credit` → verify events
- [ ] Run a default smoke: `open_credit_line` → `draw_credit` →
      `default_credit_line` → auction → `settle_default_liquidation` →
      verify line `Closed`

### 6.2 Mainnet

All testnet items plus:

- [ ] Admin is a multisig with diverse key custody (not a single key)
- [ ] `propose_admin` rotation tested end-to-end on testnet

## 7. PR / Issue Cadence

The repository has merged 332 pull requests as of the documentation cutoff
(reproduce with `git log --oneline | grep -c Merge`). Representative recent
merges (from `git log --oneline | grep -E "feat|fix|security"`):

| PR # | Title (commit subject) | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| #433 | feat: add admin-gated WASM upgrade entrypoint with version guard | Upgrade path |
| #432 | Add late-payment penalty surcharge for delinquent credit lines | Risk pricing |
| #431 | security: add reentrancy guard to auction bid refund and claim | Reentrancy hardening |
| #430 | feat: add anti-snipe end-time extension to auctions | Auction (documented gap) |
| #425 | feat: add Dutch descending-price auction mode | Auction mode |
| #424 | task/grace-waiver-tests | Test coverage |
| #423 | security/auction-factory-auth | Auth hardening |
| #422 | feat: enforce protocol min/max credit limit bounds | Risk limits |
| #421 | security: replace production unwraps with explicit contract errors | Error hygiene |
| #420 | feat: add per-borrower interest rate floor | Risk pricing |
| #419 | task/event-topic-stability | ABI guards |
| #418 | unwrap removal (continuation) | Error hygiene |
| #417 | fix/377-claim-auction-negative-tests | Auction tests |
| #416 | task/borrower-key-encoding-test | Storage-key safety |
| #415 | security/oracle-deviation-breaker | Oracle safety |
| #413 | feature/batch-accrual-keeper | Keeper hook |
| #412 | feature/repayment-schedule | Schedule feature |
| #408 | test: reentrancy guard lifecycle after failed token transfers | Rollback tests |
| #407 | fix: auction_contract place_bid | Bid math |
| #406 | feat: protocol fee accounting and treasury withdrawal | Fee accounting |
| #405 | feature/global-exposure-cap | Risk limits |
| #404 | feat: Persistent TTL bump for borrower state | TTL hygiene |
| #403 | matrix-test self_suspend_credit_line | Negative tests |
| #402 | feat(auction): min_increment_bps to prevent equal-bid griefing | Auction safety |

The pattern is visible:

- **Security and hardening PRs** (auth, reentrancy, unwrap removal, oracle
  breaker, key encoding, TTL hygiene) are present in roughly the same
  volume as feature PRs.
- **Tests are first-class deliverables.** Several PRs are purely test
  additions (e.g., #408, #424, #403, #416).
- **ABI stability is enforced by CI tests** (#419, `error_discriminants.rs`,
  `event_topic_stability.rs`).

## 10. Known State at the Documentation Cutoff

A reviewer running `cargo check --workspace` against `main` at the
documentation pass will see **65 errors** localized to known merge
artifacts in `contracts/credit/src/lifecycle.rs` (duplicate function
bodies, see `WHITEPAPER.md` §10.6) and `contracts/credit/src/risk.rs`
(duplicate `use` blocks). These are tracked in `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
as the next milestone after the documentation pass; they do not impact
the documentation, which is doc-only. The headline coverage and test
numbers are from the most recent passing build prior to those merge
conflicts.

The documentation pass is intentionally additive — no source file's
control flow or signatures were modified during this pass, only doc
comments added at module level (see `git log --oneline --grep=docs`).
