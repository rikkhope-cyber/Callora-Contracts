# Creditra System Architecture

This document describes the runtime architecture: how the two contracts and
the off-chain orchestrator are wired together, the call topology, and the
sequence of events for each core protocol flow. All component names and
function signatures are anchored in the source.

For the per-module contract surface, see `docs/PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`.
For the protocol-level model, see `WHITEPAPER.md`.

```

**Notes on the topology:**

- The credit contract is the **only** contract that mutates borrower state.
- The auction contract has no read or write access to the credit contract's
  state; the handoff is a single asserted cross-contract call.
- The off-chain orchestrator is *not* a trusted party — it is incentivized by
  protocol design to call settlement on a closed auction; if it doesn't, the
  admin can call it directly.
- The risk-scoring service is, in v1, an off-chain process whose output is
  pushed on-chain by the admin via `update_risk_parameters`. The path to
  decentralization is via `docs/default-oracle.md`.

    Credit-->>Borrower: emit ("credit","accrue") + ("credit","fee_accrd")
    Note over Credit: clear_reentrancy_guard
```

**Why interest-first?** A repayment must reduce the *cost-bearing* component
of the debt before the principal. Otherwise a borrower making the
minimum-payment-to-cover-interest would not reduce the principal, and
amortization would be unpredictable. The split is enforced by
`contracts/credit/src/lib.rs:437-556` and tested in `tests/protocol_fee.rs`.

---

## 5. Sequence: Default → Auction → Settlement

This is the full cross-contract flow. Each step has a corresponding test in
`contracts/credit/tests/credit_auction_e2e.rs`.

        Auction->>Auction: status := Closed (atomic with bid record)

    end

    Admin->>Credit: settle_default_liquidation(borrower, recovered_amount, settlement_id, oracle_price)
    Note over Credit: set_reentrancy_guard, assert_not_paused
    opt OracleConfig present
        Credit->>Credit: oracle_price valid, fresh, within deviation
        Credit->>Credit: persist OracleLastPrice/Ts atomically
        Credit-->>Indexer: emit ("credit","orc_price")
    end
    opt AuctionContract set
        Credit->>Auction: settle_default_liquidation(settlement_id, credit_addr, borrower)
        Auction->>Auction: status == Closed, factory-only, replay-protected
        Auction-->>Indexer: emit LIQ_SETL
        Auction-->>Credit: return highest_bid (i128)
        Credit->>Credit: assert return == recovered_amount else InvalidAmount
    end
    Credit->>Credit: replay-check (Symbol("liq_seen"), borrower, settlement_id)
    Credit->>Credit: decrement utilized + accrued_interest pro-rata
    alt utilized_amount == 0
        Credit->>Credit: status := Closed; clear RepaymentSchedule
    end
    Credit-->>Indexer: emit ("credit","liq_setl") = DefaultLiquidationSettledEvent
    Note over Credit: clear_reentrancy_guard
```

**Why two contracts?** The auction is replaceable. The credit contract talks
to whichever `AuctionContract` address the admin sets, and the settlement
handshake (`settle_default_liquidation` on both sides, with mutually replay-
protected markers and a return-value assertion) is the only point of
coupling. This isolates the credit invariants from changes to auction
mechanics (e.g. a future sealed-bid or batch-auction implementation).

```

Detailed transition rules are in `docs/state-machine.md` and the source at
`contracts/credit/src/lifecycle.rs`. Implementation invariants:

- `apply_accrual` is called **before** every state transition.
- `persist_credit_line(prev_utilized, line)` updates the global
  `TotalUtilized` accumulator atomically with the line write.
- `suspension_ts` is monotone non-decreasing; `assert_ts_monotonic` enforces.
- Settlement uses the `(borrower, settlement_id)` persistent dedup marker.

## 7. Storage & TTL Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Instance["Instance storage (hot, always loaded)"]
        I1["admin / proposed_admin / proposed_at"]
        I2["paused / reentrancy / DrawsFrozen"]
        I3["LiquidityToken / LiquiditySource"]
        I4["MaxDrawAmount / MaxRepayAmount / DrawMinIntervalSeconds"]
        I5["MinCreditLimit / MaxCreditLimit / MaxTotalExposure"]
        I6["MinCollateralRatioBps / PenaltySurchargeBps"]
        I7["ProtocolFeeBps / TreasuryAddress / TreasuryBalance"]
        I8["rate_cfg / rate_form / grace_cfg"]
        I9["OracleConfig / OracleLastPrice / OracleLastPriceTs"]
        I10["AuctionContract / CreditLineCount / TotalUtilized / SchemaVersion"]
    end

    subgraph Persistent["Persistent storage (per-key TTL)"]
        P1["CreditLineIdByBorrower(Address) / CreditLineBorrowerById(u32)"]
        P2["CreditLineData (under id)"]
        P3["LastDrawTs(Address)"]
        P4["BlockedBorrower(Address)"]
        P5["UtilizationCapBps(Address)"]
        P6["RateFloorBps(Address) / RateCeilingBps(Address)"]
        P7["RepaymentSchedule(Address)"]
        P8["CollateralBalance(Address)"]
        P9["DrawAudit(Address,u64) / DrawReversedAmount(Address,u64)"]
        P10["(Symbol('liq_seen'), Address, Symbol) [settlement replay]"]
    end

    TTL["LEDGER_BUMP_THRESHOLD = 1_555_200 (~3 mo)<br/>LEDGER_BUMP_AMOUNT = 3_110_400 (~6 mo)"]
    Persistent -.-> TTL
    Instance -.-> TTL
```

Every persistent read/write goes through the helpers in
`contracts/credit/src/storage.rs` which call `bump_credit_line_ttl` /
`bump_instance_ttl` on access. The cadence:

- If remaining TTL drops below `LEDGER_BUMP_THRESHOLD` (~3 months),
- extend by `LEDGER_BUMP_AMOUNT` (~6 months).

This means active borrowers' data is automatically refreshed; dormant data
(no activity in ~6 months) expires. The `accrue_batch` keeper hook
(`lib.rs:1133`, capped at `ACCRUE_BATCH_MAX = 50`) lets an indexer-driven
worker re-bump dormant lines cheaply.

The auction contract uses shorter TTLs
(`PERSISTENT_BUMP_AMOUNT = 518_400` ≈ 30 d,
`PERSISTENT_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD = 120_960` ≈ 7 d) since auctions are
short-lived by nature.

## 8. Cross-contract Call Topology

The credit contract's outward edges:

| Direction | Target | Method | Purpose | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Out | `LiquidityToken` (SAC) | `transfer(from, to, amount)` | Move funds reserve → borrower on draw | `lib.rs:261-424` |
| Out | `LiquidityToken` (SAC) | `transfer_from(from, to, amount)` | Move funds borrower → contract (fee) and borrower → reserve (principal+interest-fee) on repay | `lib.rs:437-556` |
| Out | `LiquidityToken` (SAC) | `balance(addr)` | Read reserve balance for the pre-transfer check | `lib.rs:261-424` step 19 |
| Out | `LiquidityToken` (SAC) | `transfer(contract, treasury, amount)` | Drain fee accumulator | `lib.rs:770` |
| Out | `LiquidityToken` (SAC) | `transfer(borrower, contract, amount)` | Collateral deposit | `collateral.rs:34` |
| Out | `LiquidityToken` (SAC) | `transfer(contract, borrower, amount)` | Collateral withdraw / partial release | `collateral.rs:69,partial_release_collateral` |
| Out | `AuctionContract` | `settle_default_liquidation(auction_id, credit, borrower) -> i128` | Cross-contract settlement | `lib.rs:953` |
| In  | Admin | All `set_*`, `open_credit_line`, `update_risk_parameters`, etc. | Admin operations | `auth.rs`, all `lib.rs` admin entrypoints |
| In  | Borrower | `draw_credit`, `repay_credit`, `deposit_collateral`, `withdraw_collateral`, `partial_release_collateral`, `self_suspend_credit_line`, `close_credit_line` (if utilized=0) | Borrower flows | per file |
| In  | Keeper / indexer | `accrue_batch` (no auth), all read-only queries | Maintenance | `lib.rs:1133` |

Auction contract's outward edges:

| Direction | Target | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Out | Bid token (SAC) | `transfer(contract, prev_bidder, amount)` | Refund prior English bidder under reentrancy guard |
| Out | Bid token (SAC) | `transfer(contract, winner, amount)` | (claim_auction placeholder; transfer is currently commented in source) |
| In  | Factory (credit contract) | `settle_default_liquidation(auction_id, credit, borrower)` | One-shot settlement |
| In  | Bidder | `place_bid(auction_id, bidder, amount)` | Public bid path |
| In  | Admin | `init_auction`, `close_auction`, `set_factory_contract` | Operator flow |
| In  | Winner | `claim_auction(auction_id)` | Post-settlement payout |

## 9. Trust Boundaries

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph TB1["Trust boundary: borrower wallet"]
        Borrower["Borrower wallet"]
    end
    subgraph TB2["Trust boundary: admin (multisig)"]
        Admin["Admin"]
    end
    subgraph TB3["Trust boundary: protocol (Soroban + WASM)"]
        Credit
        Auction
    end
    subgraph TB4["Trust boundary: off-chain"]
        Scorer
        Orchestrator
        Indexer
    end
    Borrower -- "require_auth verified" --> Credit
    Admin -- "require_admin_auth, propose+accept rotation" --> Credit
    Scorer -- "scalar score (admin-pushed)" --> Admin
    Orchestrator -- "init_auction, place_bid, close_auction" --> Auction
    Orchestrator -. "settle_default_liquidation (admin-gated)" .-> Credit
    Credit -- "events" --> Indexer
    Auction -- "events" --> Indexer
```

The protocol code trusts:
1. Soroban host functions (`require_auth`, `env.ledger().timestamp()`,
   storage ops, deployer).
2. The `LiquidityToken` honoring the standard token interface.
3. The admin's good faith **bounded by** the rate cap, exposure cap,
   rate-change cap, and proposal delay.

The protocol code does **not** trust:
- The off-chain scorer (the score is treated as a bounded input).
- The off-chain orchestrator (settlement is replay-protected and the
  cross-contract return is asserted).
- Hostile token contracts (reentrancy guard).
- Untrusted oracle reports (deviation + staleness breaker).

---

## 10. Event Topology (Indexing Surface)

All event topics emitted by both contracts. The off-chain indexer subscribes
to these topics and reconstructs the protocol's state machine.

| Topic (credit contract) | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|
| `("credit","opened")` | `CreditLineEvent` | New line or admin re-open |
| `("credit","drawn")` | `DrawnEvent` | Successful draw |
| `("credit","draw_rev")` | `DrawReversedEvent` | Admin reversal |
| `("credit","repay")` | `RepaymentEvent` | Successful repay |
| `("credit","accrue")` | `InterestAccruedEvent` | Whenever ΔI > 0 |
| `("credit","fee_accrd")` | `FeeAccruedEvent` | When protocol fee deducted |
| `("credit","suspend")` | `CreditLineEvent` | Admin suspend |
| `("credit","closed")` | `CreditLineEvent` | Borrower or admin close |
| `("credit","defaulted")` | `CreditLineEvent` | Admin default |
| `("credit","reinstate")` | `CreditLineEvent` | Admin reinstate |
| `("credit","liq_req")` | `(Address, i128)` | Default triggers liquidation request |
| `("credit","liq_setl")` | `DefaultLiquidationSettledEvent` | Settlement applied |
| `("credit","risk_upd")` | `RiskParametersUpdatedEvent` | `update_risk_parameters` |
| `("credit","drw_freeze")` | `DrawsFrozenEvent` | Global freeze toggle |
| `("credit","rate_form")` | `bool` | Rate formula enable/disable |
| `("credit","paused")` / `("unpaused")` | `bool` | Pause toggle |
| `("blk_chg",)` | `BorrowerBlockedEvent` | Blocklist change |
| `("credit","pen_enter")` / `("pen_exit")` | `PenaltyRate*Event` | Delinquency enter/exit |
| `("credit","col_dep")` / `("col_wit")` | `Collateral*Event` | Collateral movement |
| `("credit","admin_prop")` / `("admin_acc")` | `AdminRotation*Event` | Admin rotation |
| `("credit","orc_cfg")` | `(u32, u64)` | Oracle config set |
| `("credit","orc_price")` | `(i128, u64)` | Oracle price accepted |
| `("credit","upgraded")` | `ContractUpgradedEvent` | WASM upgrade |

| Topic (auction) | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|
| `("AUC_CLOSE", auction_id)` | `AuctionClosedEvent` | Close (manual or Dutch auto) |
| `("BID_RFDN", auction_id)` | `BidRefundedEvent` | Prior bidder refund (English) |
| `("LIQ_SETL", auction_id)` | `DefaultLiquidationSettlementEvent` | Settlement from credit factory |
