# Event Schema Documentation

**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** Authoritative  
**Scope:** `creditra-credit` (`contracts/credit/`), `gateway-auction` (`gateway-contract/contracts/auction_contract/`), `creditra-accrual` (`contracts/accrual/`), and `creditra-credit` CosmWasm (`contracts/creditra-credit/`)

## 1. Overview

This document provides a structured schema for all events emitted by the Creditra credit and auction contracts. It documents every event topic, payload structure, field types, and version stability guarantees to enable off-chain indexers, orchestrators, and integrators to reliably decode and process events.

---

## 2. Versioning Policy

### Contract API Version

The contract API version is defined in `contracts/credit/src/lib.rs` as `CONTRACT_API_VERSION = (1, 0, 0)`.

### SemVer-Style Event Schema Versioning

Event schema follows strict SemVer-style rules:

- **Major (Breaking):** Breaking changes require a new event topic with a `_vN` suffix and a contract API major version bump. Breaking changes include:
  - Renaming, removing, or reordering fields in a payload struct
  - Changing a field's type
  - Changing a topic string
  - Semantic changes to event meaning

- **Minor:** A new event topic or a new optional field at the end of an existing payload struct. Requires a contract API minor version bump.

- **Patch:** Bug fixes only; no structural changes to topics or payloads.

### Topic Suffix Convention

When a breaking change is required, introduce a new topic with a suffix and keep the old topic alive during a dual-publish window:

```
("credit", "drawn_v2")   // new version
("credit", "drawn")      // legacy version; still emitted
```

Remove the legacy topic only after downstream indexers confirm cutover.

---

## 3. Topic Encoding

Topics are Soroban `Symbol` values chosen to use the cheap `SCV_SYMBOL` on-chain encoding (≤ 9 characters). Symbols longer than 9 characters use `Symbol::new(env, "<longer-name>")` and cost more gas to publish.

| Encoding rule | Limit |
|---|---|
| `symbol_short!` macro | ≤ 9 characters |
| `Symbol::new` | Up to 32 characters |

The first topic in every published tuple is either `"credit"` (credit contract), `"accrual"` (accrual contract), or a short identifier such as `"blk_chg"` or `"BID_RFDN"`.

---
