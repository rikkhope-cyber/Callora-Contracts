# Creditra Event Schema Reference

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Superseded by [`docs/EVENTS_CATALOG.md`](../EVENTS_CATALOG.md)  
**Scope:** `creditra-credit` (`contracts/credit/`)

---

## 1. Overview

This document is the canonical reference for all events emitted by the Creditra credit contract. Every event topic, payload struct, and field order is documented here, along with a clear versioning policy for safe schema evolution.

## 2. Versioning Policy (SemVer-style)

### Schema Stability Rules

The contract API version is defined in `contracts/credit/src/lib.rs:60` as `CONTRACT_API_VERSION = (1, 0, 0)`. Event schema follows:

- **Major:** Breaking changes (rename/remove/reorder fields, topic name changes, semantic changes require a new version with a `_vN` suffix. Examples:
  - `("credit","drawn_v2`
  - `("credit","repay_v2`

- **Minor:** New event topics or new optional fields at the *end* of existing payload structs, but only via new fields in same topic only with a version suffix (not existing payloads still backward compatible.

- **Patch:** Bug fixes only; no breaking changes.

### Topic Encoding Rationale

Topics use `symbol_short!` (≤ 9 chars) to use cheap `SCV_SYMBOL` on-chain encoding, when ≤9 is `Symbol::new(env, "<longer-name` (up to 32 chars) when length > 9.
