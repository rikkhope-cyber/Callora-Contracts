# `ContractError` reference

Authoritative table of every error code the `creditra-credit` contract can
return. Source of truth: `contracts/credit/src/types.rs`.

Regenerate with:

```bash
scripts/list_contract_errors.py
```

## Stability

Discriminants are part of the contract ABI. Existing variants must never
be reordered or renumbered; new variants must be appended.

Each variant also belongs to a stable [`ContractErrorCategory`](../contracts/credit/src/types.rs)
accessible via [`ContractError::category()`](../contracts/credit/src/types.rs).
See the [category enum reference](#contracterrorcategory) below.

## `ContractErrorCategory`

[`ContractErrorCategory`](../contracts/credit/src/types.rs) is a stable
`#[repr(u32)]` enum that groups `ContractError` variants into 11 named
categories. Access it at runtime via [`ContractError::category()`](../contracts/credit/src/types.rs).

| Code | Category | Variants |
| ---: | -------- | -------- |

| 4  | Limit | `OverLimit`, `UtilizationNotZero`, `LimitDecreaseRequiresRepayment`, `DrawExceedsMaxAmount`, `RepayExceedsMaxAmount`, `CloseFactorAboveMax`, `DrawReversalWindowExpired`, `UtilizedNotZero` |
| 5  | Liquidity | `MissingLiquidityToken`, `MissingLiquiditySource`, `InsufficientLiquidityReserve`, `LiquidityTokenCallFailed`, `InsufficientRepaymentAllowance`, `InsufficientRepaymentBalance`, `TreasuryNotSet`, `ExposureCapExceeded`, `BountyNotSet`, `InsufficientReserve`, `InsufficientAllowance`, `InsufficientBalance` |

## Taxonomy

See [`docs/ERROR_CODES.md`](./ERROR_CODES.md) for the authoritative
grouping of all 59 variants into **named categories** (Auth, Lifecycle,
Numeric, Limit, Liquidity, Risk, Oracle, Collateral, Block, Reentrancy, Misc)
with **SDK-side recovery actions** per category.
