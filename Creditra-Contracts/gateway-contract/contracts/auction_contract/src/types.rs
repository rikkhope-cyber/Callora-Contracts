//! Auction contract type definitions.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! ABI types shared between the auction `#[contractimpl]` block and storage:
//!
//! - [`AuctionMode`] — English (ascending) or Dutch (descending) bid model.
//! - [`AuctionStatus`] — Open → Closed → Claimed terminal lifecycle.
//! - [`AuctionConfig`] — immutable per-auction parameters set at init.
//! - [`DutchAuctionDecay`] — Dutch price-curve shape (linear or stepped).
//! - [`AuctionState`] — mutable bid state (highest bidder & bid amount).
//! - [`Bid`] — single-bid record (currently informational, not persisted
//!   per-bid).
//! - [`DataKey`] — instance-storage keys used by the auction contract.
//! - [`AuctionKey`] — id-scoped persistent keys for the alternate storage
//!   API exposed by [`crate::storage`].
//!
//! # How
//!
//! All types are `#[contracttype]`-tagged so they cross the Soroban host ABI
//! boundary as structured values. Discriminants are ABI-stable; new variants
//! must be appended (see `gateway-contract/contracts/auction_contract/src/errors.rs`
//! for the same discipline applied to [`crate::errors::AuctionError`]).
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! The English mode is the protocol's default for asset disposal: bidders
//! atomically refund the previous highest bidder under the reentrancy guard
//! when outbid. The Dutch mode is included so the credit contract's default-
//! liquidation handoff can settle on a known-bounded timeline — first
//! qualifying bid wins and closes the auction in the same transaction.
//!
//! # Storage tier
//!
//! The instance `DataKey` variants store the *current* auction's
//! configuration and state in instance storage (small, hot). The persistent
//! [`AuctionKey`] variants — `Seller(id)`, `Asset(id)`, etc. — encode an
//! id-scoped namespace used by the alternate API in [`crate::storage`] when
//! the contract serves multiple auctions concurrently.
//!
//! See [`docs/default-liquidation-auction-hook.md`](../../../../docs/default-liquidation-auction-hook.md)
//! for the cross-contract settlement protocol.
